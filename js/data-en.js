        '</ol>\n' +
        '<p><strong>Reasoning</strong></p>\n' +
        '<p>I wanted to have the experience of the various different roles involved in software development - scrum master, front end developer, back end developer, project manager, to ensure that I had the skills to complete a technical project of sufficient depth independently. This process also allowed me to learn Angular 2+ along the way, which was quite different in terms of syntax and complexity than AngularJS.</p>\n' +
        '<p>I also started learning Python and React, but decided that without a context to apply these technologies, it would be difficult to learn them to a fluent enough level.</p>\n' +
        '<p>In terms of my product launches, I wanted to complete what I didn&rsquo;t manage to learn during my gap year - doing product launches. I thought it would be instrumental understanding how to (1) build an audience; (2) create appropriate content for that audience; (3) do an entire product launch from crafting a salesletter to product design and the launch itself. And once I had a large enough audience, I decided to start selling. </p>' +

        '<p><strong>Reasoning</strong></p>\n' +
        '<p>Being a teacher has always been a dream of mine, and I wanted to see if it was really something for me, or if it would be different from what I expected. I was also able to become a better presenter and speaker, jumping between different languages, breaking the ice and creating conversation when students found it difficult to speak.</p>\n' +
        '<p>However, and surprisingly, I concluded that being a teacher wasn&rsquo;t for me, because I found it very difficult to teach students who all had different objectives, levels and styles of learning. Perhaps I might fare better teaching to a larger group or teaching something different.</p>\n' +
        '<p>I wanted to create the platform and website as an extension of that desire to teach. Also, I wanted to explore the platform as a possible way to monetize from my efforts, but decided against it because I simply didn&rsquo;t have an audience. I then thought, based on my understanding of the sales funnel, to start with creating a presence and selling lower end products before investing a big chunk of time and energy into such a complex platform, which was the beginning of my Cantonese website. </p>' +

        '</ol>\n' +
        '<p><strong>Reasoning</strong></p>\n' +
        '<p>The reason I listed &ldquo;graduating college&rdquo; as an objective was because I had difficulty with certain classes in college, the Pure Math and Physics classes to be precise. 70% of my primary and secondary education had been in English, so I had to expend more effort than my classmates to get through these classes in Mandarin. But with the help from teachers and classmates at various times, I managed it.</p>\n' +
        '<p>As part of the curriculum requirements, I applied for various firms for internship positions. While I had succeeded in passing the interview rounds in companies such as IBM, Lenovo and SAP (larger firms had more internship positions), I was rejected because of visa issues. I was fortunate enough to find an opportunity at italki, and had the opportunity to develop my front end development skills in a team that subscribed to agile methodologies (Scrum). I am also very grateful to italki for allowing me to take on a very involved role despite being an intern, such as organizing documentation for the code base, design E2E tests in Protractor, and also the opportunity to write Python. However, while I had read enough of the code in Python to start contributing, I left before taking on back end development responsibilities. </p>' +

        '<p><strong>Reasoning</strong>&nbsp;</p>\n' +
        '<p>During my sophomore year, I was both stressed and frustrated with my school work - stressed because I only had a rudimentary understanding of physics from my high school years, and learning college physics proved to be very difficult; frustrated because I felt that I was lacking in breadth in terms of what we learned, and wanted some real project experience.</p>\n' +
        '<p>During my gap year, I thought it might be a valuable addition to my skillset and experience to take on marketing projects, with a focus on eCommerce. I had experimented with other ways of building affiliate sites, but those proved very difficult to grow. I also worked as a freelance SEO writer during that time to experience what it was like working remote and on a flexible schedule.</p>\n' +
        '<p>However, I remember distinctly feeling excited with the prospects of undertaking the eCommerce projects that I did, because it was I time when I remembered getting some good feedback from what I did, including having great AdWords CTRs (highest being 8.77%), and generating $1616.73 in sales during the holiday period. Unfortunately, due to a lack of funds (AdWords was very expensive upfront), I had to abandon the project.</p>\n' +
        '<p>During that year, I managed to learn good SEO fundamentals (on page and off page), to reach out and negotiate with American suppliers, manage AdWords campaigns and lowering CPC, do market research to determine good products to sell, determine a suitable pricing strategy, and actually sell physical products. </p>' +

        '<p>What was noteworthy in this period of time, until the rest of my college years was my addition of Korean and Spanish to my languages I speak, interspersed with French and Japanese sessions to keep up with those. While I hadn&rsquo;t learned Spanish to a high enough level, I do feel comfortable enough with Korean to handle daily communications, all through self study. </p>' +
